NAME
    POEx::ZMQ3 - POE-enabled asynchronous ZeroMQ components

SYNOPSIS
      This is an early development release.
      Many pieces are missing, including this SYNOPSIS.

DESCRIPTION
    A set of roles and classes providing a POE-enabled asynchronous
    interface to ZeroMQ (version 3).

    This is an early development release. GitHub:
    <http://github.com/avenj/poex-zmq3>

  Classes
    POEx::ZMQ3::Publisher and POEx::ZMQ3::Subscriber implement PUB and SUB
    type ZeroMQ sockets.

    POEx::ZMQ3::Requestor and POEx::ZMQ3::Replier implement REQ and REP type
    sockets.

    These are very simple base implementations.

  Roles
    POEx::ZMQ3::Role::Sockets is the basic asynchronous POE interface to
    ZMQ::LibZMQ3 sockets; it can be used to add ZeroMQ sockets to any Moo
    class.

    POEx::ZMQ3::Role::Endpoints adds a layer of easy ZMQ socket
    endpoint/target management to POEx::ZMQ3::Role::Sockets.

    MooX::Role::POE::Emitter provides POE event emitter functionality.
