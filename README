NAME
    POEx::ZMQ3 - POE-enabled asynchronous ZeroMQ components

SYNOPSIS
      use POEx::ZMQ3;
      ## A POEx::ZMQ3::Sockets instance:
      my $zmq = POEx::ZMQ3->new;

    (See POEx::ZMQ3::Sockets for a complete example.)

DESCRIPTION
    A set of roles and classes providing a POE-enabled asynchronous
    interface to ZeroMQ (version 3) via ZMQ::LibZMQ3.

    ZeroMQ is a powerful high-performance messaging library aimed at
    concurrent/distributed applications. (If you're just getting started
    with ZeroMQ, it is strongly advised you read the 'zguide'
    (<http://zguide.zeromq.org>) before jumping in.)

    This project attempts to stay on top of changes in ZeroMQ and the
    relevant Perl bindings. You will need zeromq-3.2.2 or newer:
    <http://www.zeromq.org>

  Classes
    POEx::ZMQ3::Sockets is the backend ZMQ component. It can be used
    directly to add flexible ZeroMQ functionality to your POE applications.

    There are some higher-level components providing simple access to single
    sockets belonging to basic types:

    POEx::ZMQ3::Publisher and POEx::ZMQ3::Subscriber implement PUB and SUB
    type ZeroMQ sockets.

    POEx::ZMQ3::Requestor and POEx::ZMQ3::Replier implement REQ and REP type
    sockets.

    These are very simple base implementations. They can be subclassed or
    combined in varied ways to do more powerful things. As of this writing,
    more advanced socket types are lacking component classes, but these can
    be easily implemented with POEx::ZMQ3::Sockets.

  Roles
    MooX::Role::POE::Emitter provides POE event emitter functionality and
    some endpoint management methods.

BUGS
    Probably many; this software is fairly early in development.

    See <http://github.com/avenj/poex-zmq3> and feel free to report bugs via
    either RT or GitHub.
