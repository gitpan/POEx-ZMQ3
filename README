NAME
    POEx::ZMQ3 - POE-enabled asynchronous ZeroMQ components

SYNOPSIS
      use POEx::ZMQ3;
      my $zmq = POEx::ZMQ3->new;

    (See POEx::ZMQ3::Sockets for a more complete example.)

DESCRIPTION
    A set of roles and classes providing a POE-enabled asynchronous
    interface to ZeroMQ (version 3) via ZMQ::LibZMQ3.

    ZeroMQ is a powerful high-performance messaging library aimed at
    concurrent/distributed applications. (If you're just getting started
    with ZeroMQ, it is strongly advised you read the 'zguide'
    (<http://zguide.zeromq.org>) before jumping in.)

    This is an early development release; interfaces are potentially subject
    to change. Help would be welcome, of course -- jump in on GitHub:

  Classes
    POEx::ZMQ3::Sockets is the backend ZMQ component. It can be used
    directly to add flexible ZeroMQ functionality to your POE applications.

    There are some higher-level components providing simple access to single
    sockets belonging to basic types:

    POEx::ZMQ3::Publisher and POEx::ZMQ3::Subscriber implement PUB and SUB
    type ZeroMQ sockets.

    POEx::ZMQ3::Requestor and POEx::ZMQ3::Replier implement REQ and REP type
    sockets.

    These are very simple base implementations. They can be subclassed or
    combined in varied ways to do more powerful things.

  Roles
    MooX::Role::POE::Emitter provides POE event emitter functionality and
    some endpoint management methods.

BUGS
    Probably many; this software is fairly early in development.

    See <http://github.com/avenj/poex-zmq3> and feel free to report bugs via
    either RT or GitHub.
