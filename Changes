  - Publisher; Add ->publish_multipart()

  - Fix dependency on MooX::Role::POE::Emitter.

0.02 2013-01-11

  - zmqsock_recv no longer broadcasts the ZMQ message object
    Seems like a waste of memory for most cases.
    Will likely end up adding a configurable attrib to include it;
    may still be useful for darker forms of magic.

  - Proper multi-part message support:
     zmqsock_multipart_recv
     write_multipart
