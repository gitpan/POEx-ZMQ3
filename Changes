## Changes for POEx::ZMQ3

  * 0.04     (13 Jan 2013)
    Socket-specific classes now use their Emitter's alias as their
    socket alias as well, making it easier to address their socket
    directly by referring to it as '$instance->alias'

  * 0.03     (12 Jan 2013)
    Publisher; Add ->publish_multipart()

    Fix dependency on MooX::Role::POE::Emitter.
    Need at least 0.11.

    Small optimizations and cleanups.

  * 0.02     (11 Jan 2013)
    INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
     - zmqsock_recv no longer broadcasts the ZMQ message object
       Seems like a waste of memory for most cases.
       Will likely end up adding a configurable attrib to include it;
       may still be useful for darker forms of magic.

    Proper multi-part message support:
     - zmqsock_multipart_recv
     - write_multipart

  * 0.01     (11 Jan 2013)
    Minor cleanups; first non-devel release.

  * 0.00_10  (11 Jan 2013)
    Re-designed/re-worked:
     - POEx::ZMQ3::Sockets added. This is the new backend component.
     - POEx::ZMQ3::Role::Sockets no longer exists
       (nor does Role::Endpoints)

    This release clears all current known bugs.

  * 0.00_05  (10 Jan 2013)
    FD may be ready-to-read immediately after a write, but
    we may not catch an event.
    This release fixes req-rep pairs as seen in examples/

    However, the backend interfaces are likely to change
    (see scratchpad branch in git).

  * 0.00_04  (5 Jan 2013)
    Be a bit more "safe" in how we treat REP / REQ pairs.

  * 0.00_03  (5 Jan 2013)
    Pass tests somewhat more consistently.

  * 0.00_02  (5 Jan 2013)
    Eliminate some test failures.
    Still running into some flaky SIGABRTs.

  * 0.00_01  (5 Jan 2013)
    Initial development release.
