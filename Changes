## Changes for POEx::ZMQ3

  * 0.00_10  (11 Jan 2013)
    Re-designed/re-worked:
     - POEx::ZMQ3::Sockets added. This is the new backend component.
     - POEx::ZMQ3::Role::Sockets no longer exists
       (nor does Role::Endpoints)

    This release clears all current known bugs.

  * 0.00_05  (10 Jan 2013)
    FD may be ready-to-read immediately after a write, but
    we may not catch an event.
    This release fixes req-rep pairs as seen in examples/

    However, the backend interfaces are likely to change
    (see scratchpad branch in git).

  * 0.00_04  (5 Jan 2013)
    Be a bit more "safe" in how we treat REP / REQ pairs.

  * 0.00_03  (5 Jan 2013)
    Pass tests somewhat more consistently.

  * 0.00_02  (5 Jan 2013)
    Eliminate some test failures.
    Still running into some flaky SIGABRTs.

  * 0.00_01  (5 Jan 2013)
    Initial development release.
