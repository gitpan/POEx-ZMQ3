=head1 NAME

POEx::ZMQ3 - POE-enabled asynchronous ZeroMQ components

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use POEx::ZMQ3;
  ## A POEx::ZMQ3::Sockets instance:
  my $zmq = POEx::ZMQ3->new;

(See L<POEx::ZMQ3::Sockets> for a complete example.)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A set of roles and classes providing a L<POE>-enabled asynchronous interface
to B<ZeroMQ> (version 3) via L<ZMQ::LibZMQ3>.

ZeroMQ is a powerful high-performance messaging library aimed at
concurrent/distributed applications. (If you're just getting started with
ZeroMQ, it is strongly advised you read the 'zguide'
(L<http://zguide.zeromq.org>) before jumping in.)

This project attempts to stay on top of changes in ZeroMQ and the relevant
Perl bindings. 
You will need B<zeromq-3.2.2> or newer: L<http://www.zeromq.org>

=head2 Classes

L<POEx::ZMQ3::Sockets> is the backend ZMQ component. It can be used directly
to add flexible ZeroMQ functionality to your POE applications.

There are some higher-level components providing simple access to single
sockets belonging to basic types:

L<POEx::ZMQ3::Publisher> and L<POEx::ZMQ3::Subscriber> implement PUB and SUB
type ZeroMQ sockets.

L<POEx::ZMQ3::Requestor> and L<POEx::ZMQ3::Replier> implement REQ and REP type
sockets.

These are very simple base implementations. They can be subclassed or combined
in varied ways to do more powerful things. 
As of this writing, more advanced socket types are lacking component classes,
but these can be easily implemented with L<POEx::ZMQ3::Sockets>.

=head2 Roles

L<MooX::Role::POE::Emitter> provides L<POE> event emitter functionality and
some endpoint management methods.

=head1 BUGS

Probably many; this software is fairly early in development.

See L<http://github.com/avenj/poex-zmq3> and feel free to report bugs via
either B<RT> or B<GitHub>.
