A set of roles and classes providing a L<POE>-enabled asynchronous interface
to B<ZeroMQ> (version 3).

This is an early development release.
GitHub: L<http://github.com/avenj/poex-zmq3>

=head2 Classes

L<POEx::ZMQ3::Sockets> is the backend ZMQ component. It can be used directly
to add ZeroMQ functionality to your POE applications.

L<POEx::ZMQ3::Publisher> and L<POEx::ZMQ3::Subscriber> implement PUB and SUB
type ZeroMQ sockets.

L<POEx::ZMQ3::Requestor> and L<POEx::ZMQ3::Replier> implement REQ and REP type
sockets.

These are very simple base implementations.

L<MooX::Role::POE::Emitter> provides L<POE> event emitter functionality and
some endpoint management methods.
